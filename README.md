# 🧠 Internship Report – Generative Models for Data Augmentation

🚀 **Organization:** CRNS  
📅 **Duration:** July 1 – August 1  
👩‍💻 **Author:** Oumaima Bourmech

## 📘 Overview

This internship report explores the use of advanced generative models for **data augmentation**, focusing on real-world challenges such as:

- ⚖️ Class imbalance  
- 📉 Small and noisy datasets  

The project evaluates multiple deep generative models to generate synthetic samples for improving downstream model performance.

## 🧪 Models Explored

- 🔹 **DCGAN** – Deep Convolutional GAN  
- 🔹 **WGAN / WGAN-GP** – Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty  
- 🔹 **StyleGAN** – Style-based architecture with progressive growing  
- 🔹 **cGAN** – Conditional GAN for class-conditioned generation  
- 🔹 **Conditional DDPM** – Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models with label guidance
